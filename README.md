** I already created one with the repo, so I hope me editing/adding to it is okay.\n**

<sub>I partnered up with Jordan and we both created a repo on Github.\n</sub>
<sup>From there we used Git Bash and cloned our repository as well as each 
other's. On our own repo, we created a file called "data.txt" which was used
 in a collaboration effort where we created forks of our partner's repo and
 added our own code to each others file. Learning how to add, commit, and push
data/files into a partner's repo, then having them merge and accept the changes. \n</sup>
